# File_TableDelimited
### A modern Component for Reading Delimited Text Files

I often need the applications I write to import and process information from tab-delimited/csv files. Everytime almost the same code is needed to open, vaildate and prepare it for processing with loads of arrays and handling the positions that that columns might appear in.

This component lets you hide away the complexity of loading the delimited file into an object with named attributes that align with the columns in the file.

## Features
- The file can be tab-delmited, comma delimited, comma delimted with a custom separator
- The columns can be in any order
- The data within the columns is type casted
- Columns can be optional or required
- Handle any EOL (e.g. CR, LF, CRLF)

## Requirements
- 4D v18 is required.
- Files must contain tabular data.

## Installation and Use
Copy the `File_TableDelimited.4dbase` into the Components folder of your application. It is suggested that you compile the component before installing it into your own projects.
